# GTAOnline Orbital Cannon


#### Change Orbital Cannon Ammunition

> the effects have to be simulated using a bit of creativity, but the finished concept is fun once put together

- enable an orbital lightning strike
- enable an orbital firestorm
- enable orbital meteor strike (using meteors as ammunition for the orbital strike, this would be good for an Outer Space DLC)


#### I love, love, love, love the orbital cannon.

#### How much do I love the orbital cannon?

I think I asked Rockstar about implementing this feature a few times before it was actually implemented.
I'm not going to say Rockstar included an orbital cannon because I specifically asked, but if they did, 
you can thank on me that one.

Now you're probably wondering, "Who the fuck wants an orbital cannon in a game like GTAOnline?"

I'm your answer.


Is your mind blown?

I'll try to dig up the requests for an orbital cannon-type ability from Rockstar for some type of proof. I sent the requests way before they changed their
feedback system for GTAOnline.

The more you know, right?


#### update

Orbital cannon ability request found. I requested a drone strike ability with a powerful missile, but was pleasantly surprised when Rockstar released an
orbital cannon. 

Basically, I wanted Rockstar to add the ability for a player to take out another player regardless of where the target-player
was located. A drone strike would have sufficed, but an orbital cannon is oustanding.

#### the celebrity of drones (i love this thing)

This is the drone I had in mind, but the orbital cannon meets the functionality of the drone strike.

I asked for drone usage (or drone strike ability) on more than one occasion.
