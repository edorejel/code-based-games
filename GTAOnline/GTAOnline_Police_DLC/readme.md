# GTAOnline Police DLC (no title yet)

- I have no relation to Rockstar games.

- __4.28.2021__ With the current events happening now, I don't think this DLC will happen, but you never know. A GTAOnline Police K9 dlc could work though. 
- Sample GTAOnline K9 DLC found here: https://github.com/xpqx/code-based-games/tree/main/GTAOnline/GTAOnline_K9_DLC#experimental-concepts-for-gtaonline-using-dogs-as-player-reward-upgrades

~~A police DLC is rumored to be happening in GTAOnline. I made up titles for it.~~ 

(I don't think this will happen in the current iteration of GTAOnline. It feels like there is no room for it. This is a tough one to call. Can it be done or no? Hmmmm....)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Might be happening!!!!!

I don't like the title "Cops and Crooks". It does not work for me.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Police DLC might be happening, this time for reals. 

> i'm curious, can't wait for the trailer, rockstar makes some of the best video game trailers

### GTAOnline Police DLC Properties
- Allow players to establish headquarters at various police stations. Police stations are now assumed to function
similar to how properties such as apartment buildings, garages, and houses function.
- If player is engaged in "POLICE_MODE", player can walk in and out of police stations without a wanted-level.
- If player is not engaged in "POLICE_MODE", player cannot walk into police stations without receiving a wanted-level.
- If a player is engaged in "POLICE_MODE", the players can enter police stations outside of their jurisdiction, but the 
players will not have access to "POLICE_MODES_AND_POLICE_WORK" outside of their jurisdiction.

- Not everyone can be a cop, so allow a limited number of players per lobby to engage in "POLICE_MODE".

- I would like to see ride-alongs with the Los Santos Police Department.
- Players can ride with the LSPD while engaged in "POLICE_MODE".
- Players can be assigned a partner police AI, or the players can drive a police car without a partner.
- Once players buy into the police lifestyle, players can have the option of CALLING THE POLICE on other players.
- Players can then target other players with a police raid. The raids can range from 1 star to 4 stars.
- Each wanted-level that a player selects to target another player shall have a different price.
- The higher the wanted-level, the higher the price, but the greater the reward. For example, if a player is being
attacked by tryhards or jet griefers, the player that is being attacked can call a 4-star wanted level against the players
that are attacking.
- enable police_AI to beat other players with nightsticks, enable a serious police_AI beatdown
- when other players are conducting sell missions, enable police_AI to target the players, if police_AI eliminate a player during the sell mission, their sell-cargo is confiscated as well as their distribution location
- While engaged in "POLICE_MODE", player will have immunity from LSPD, NOOSE, and the other agencies of San Andreas except
the military.
- While engaged in "POLICE_MODE", player will not have access to individual attire.
- After disengaging from "POLICE_MODE" player shall not have access to police attire.
- To make the player comply with the rule that "PLAYER SHALL NOT WEAR POLICE ATTIRE WHILE NOT ENGAGED IN POLICE_MODE", 
force the player to respawn in the lobby.
- The player can be forced to respawn in several funny and creative ways to keep in line with GTAOnline and Rockstar humor.
- For example, here are a couple of ways Rockstar can force players to remove police attire AND make them respawn without the
police attire:
#### Method_1 Not a Cop, Get Shot I
1. Player quits "POLICE_MODE", to force the player to remove police attire AND respawn, have the player be detected as an
imposter by the LSPD AI, and NOOSE, so that player immediately earns a 5-star wanted-level. The law enforcement agencies, shall
in this instance ONLY, attack the player so hard, and so fast, the player will lose the battle.
Upon losing the battle, the player dies, respawns, and is wearing the attire they were wearing before engaging in "POLICE_MODE".

#### Method_2 Not a Cop, Get Shot II
2. Player quits "POLICE_MODE", force player to respawn without police attire by being shot in a drive-by. The drive-by will be
performed by the gang AI. The gang AI will also use heavy firepower to take out the player. The firepower will be so intense, that the player will have no choice, but to lose the battle. Upon losing, player respawns without police attire.



#### Method_3 You're Not My Master (or Who's the B#tch Now?)

3. Player quits "POLICE_MODE", force the player to respawn without police attire by spawning a K-9 police dog
that will attack the player until the player dies. The attack by the police dog will be so vicious that the player
will have no choice, but to lose energy and die to eventually respawn without police attire.

__More to come.__

#### Anti-cheat Anti-glitch Properties
__Methods_1, Method_2, and Method_3__ above can be used as deterrents to prevent the player from glitching the police uniforms to wear them
while not engaged in "POLICE_MODE". If a player wears police attire while not engaged in "POLICE_MODE", call the methods against the player until the players remove the police attire, or the players are forced to start a new session in a different
lobby. 

Repeat the processes until the player removes the police attire.

To prevent abuse of these mechanisms by the players, allow "POLICE_MODE" to be engaged at certain time intervals. Some players
will try to glitch the police uniforms just to engage in intense firefights against the AI in GTAOnline. How do I know? Fuck, it's GTAOnline. That alone should tell you.
