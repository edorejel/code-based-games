Set-up Five occurs after a series of important and tragic events have already happened. Some of those events will be unreleased. 
I sent them to Rockstar. That's all that matters.

    Set-Up and Heist Information: Set-up Five

    Title: After Dark

    Rationale for title: Criminal mastermind husband and rogue FIB wife go into hiding. 
    They go dark after learning who got out of jail and who is helping him. They know what's coming.
    
    Motivation for this set-up: ATM machines are an integral part of life. Since ATMs are ubiquitous objects, 
    I thought it would be easy to implement them into the GTAOnline game play so that players
    have to hack ATMs. In GTAOnline, we don't hack any ATMs even though they exist in the game.
    
    Data analysis was also a big influencer in this set-up. Data is another ubiquitous object in life. I thought 
    it would be cool for the players to perform minor data analyses to reach an objective.
    
    
    New update: Players go to stores during the day, then break into database at the store. 
    CCTV put on a loop or hack the CCTV, go into the back room of the business,
    hack into the store database, find the data, analyze it, and steal the required data. 
    Set up players to be able to fulfill these objectives.
    
    If players steal data or money that is not an objective, the mission fails. 
        
    If players bump into security guards, or harass customers or are perceived as rude by the customers, or 
    do not put the CCTV on a loop or hack the CCTV, the mission fails.
    The CCTV will not be on a loop forever. If time runs out and CCTV exits the loop, the mission fails.
    
    


I might revise and resubmit. Perhaps it inspires Rockstar in some way to help shape GTA Online.
I might definitely revise this a little bit. A lot has changed since 2017.
