Small optimizations to add to the diversity in GTAOnline as well as expand the capabilities of some current in-game products.


# GTAOnline Military Mayhem DLC

*(Full Blown Military Update: Made in America)*

> __2.15.2021 My thoughts:__ Thinking about this DLC and how much I've grown as a person and developer, I don't think there is room for a full blown military dlc, but then again, I don't know what goes on behind the scenes at Rockstar HQ.

>

> This military DLC should be a full blown Call of Duty type DLC. Not Gunrunning related at all. Strictly hardcore military DLC.  We want to bring Call of Duty into GTAOnline in the most hardcore way imaginable (or using whatever concept is allowable in GTAOnline). 

### Enable 'Buying into' Bad Sport Lobbies

- For this DLC, I'd like the option to buy into and out of bad sport. Create Bad Sport club cards or something similar.


### Rank Structure

- Rank structure should follow the rank structure commonly used in the U.S. Armed Forces, but with slight changes as required.

### Possible Missions and Military Unit Work

- All missions should have a military-feel to them.
- All missions should require new or old military vehicles and technology.
- I would like a car with a flamethrowing ability attached to it somehow.



### Upgrades to Current In-game Vehicles

#### Hydra

__Hydra Aircraft__
- Hydra: upgrades in armor

>

#### Valkyrie




__Valkyrie__

- Valkyrie: upgrades in armor
- Valkyrie: upgrade in livery
- Valkyrie: upgrade in missile defense system
- Valkyrie: upgrades in missile variety: 
- heat-seeking

#### Ultimate goal of a military mayhem DLC 

- Turn the Savage into an extreme combat machine for free roam lobbies.
- Turn the Hydra into an extreme combat machine for free roam lobbies.
- Turn the Valkyrie into an extreme combat machine for free roam lobbies.




#### Upgrades in Weapons 

- __emp grenade launcher:__ player held grenade launcher that fires an emp grenade to stop any vehicle with an emp blast. In GTAOnline, players
receive bad sport points if they destroy a player vehicle. Using an emp grenade launcher, players can fire an emp grenade
to stop a car, for example, then move in and take out the player to increase their K/D without destroying a player's car.

- __emp bullets:__ bullets that fire an emp blast. The emp bullets serve the same purpose as the emp grenade launcher. Use the bullets to stop a vehicle or fire an electric emp blast at a player. We can pretend the emp bullet can hit the player temporarily paralyzing the player. The time of paralysis should be just enough for the player to move in, and neutralize the player to increase their K/D.

- By enabling emp ammunition in GTAOnline, players can stop destroying player vehicles while increasing their own K/D ratio.

- __concussion grenade launcher:__ include a concussion grenade launcher/flashbang grenade launcher. Add in the ear ringing 
effect to really capture the essence of this weapon.

### New CEO and VIP Missions


> inspiration: I was playing GTAOnline the other day, I called Pegasus for a Rhino Tank drop, and decided to attack every
> police station in San Andreas for no reason. I thought it was fun, and I felt my destructive behavior in-game should be
> rewarded. Thus, this idea was born.
> This was created in less than 10 minutes. It might need some work, but the concept is understandable.
>
> The Rhino tank for this mission will require upgrades in armor, and missile defense systems.
> The missile defense system will have two flare variants for heat seeking missile redirection.
> The flare system will shoot out four flares to redirect heat-seeking missiles.
> The system will have an option to do this automatically as a missile approaches.
> 20 flare shots of four flares will be fired automatically to redirect heat seeking missiles.
> 10 automatica flare shots of four flares will remain after the 20 automatic flares have been used up.
> Total flares in system: 30 shots of four flares to redirect missiles.
> Enhance the armor of the Rhino tank, and this tank is a fucking beast.
> Anti-lock on ability to prevent missile lock-on. Chaffe in GTAOnline is usually used for this concept.


1. Upon creating a GTAOnline Military DLC, create a CEO or VIP work wherein the player, as a Military Colonel, will
drive around in an old school Rhino Tank and destroy various police stations around San Andreas. 
2. The player must destroy all police stations before the tank explodes from taking damage, 
the tank explodes because another player blew it up, or the mission timer runs out.
3. This tank mission is just like doing CEO work such as Hostile Takeover or Headhunter. There difference is that this
DLC will be a full blown military DLC, and the player in charge of the organization will be a Colonel instead of a CEO.
4. Aircraft carriers can be introduced to be used in-game as the headquarters of the Colonels.
5. To purchase an aircraft carrier, the player is required to own the following:

- a yacht
- a hydra jet
- a lazaar jet

6. Upon purchasing the aircraft carrier, the player trades in the yacht for the aircraft carrier, and the ability to
do missions as a Colonel in GTAOnline. The player will have the option of building up their miitary unit similar to
how CEOs and MC Biker can recruit members. The difference is that the Colonel will be recruiting members as military 
personnel instead of as business associates or biker associates.


7. To unlock the Military Unit Missions, the player will have to own the vehicle associated with the mission. For example, for
the mission to drive around San Andreas in a Rhino Tank with the goal of destroying every police station, the player will be 
required to own a Rhino Tank. Just having the aircraft carrier is not grounds for having access to the Military Unit missions.
