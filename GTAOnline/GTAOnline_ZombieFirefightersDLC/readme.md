This could be a DLC for the current iteration of GTA Online.

I'll explore this further.

A requirement for this type of DLC would be that players can eat the brains of other players while in zombie mode.
The video game camera would be able to zoom in on the player eating the brains of another player.
Include zombie firetruck and other related zombie firefighter vehicles.
Fighters would look like zombies wearing firefighter outfits.


Caveat: Why did I choose zombie firefighters and not regular firefighters? GTA Online currently does not have much readily available animations or missions for normal
firefighters. However, when you add zombies into the mix, then a zombie firefighter DLC could be done.
