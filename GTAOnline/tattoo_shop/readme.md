# Torso

Testing out the ink on the player, I have found these optimizations:

- The back of the players should be split up into two parts. One part designated for upper back, and one part designated for lower back.
- The chest of the players should also be split up for upper-chest tattoos, left side of chest and right side of chest tattoos.
- More colorful tattoos should be added.
