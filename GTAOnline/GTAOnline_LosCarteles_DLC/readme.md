# GTAOnline Los Carteles DLC

> a full-blown narco-cartel DLC wherein the players actually go to Mexico, no time to develop this concept right now, but I would like the Spanish in the title to give the DLC a more authenticate and realistic vibe


- entertain the possibility of creating a DLC that focuses on the cartels, the players can maybe do these missions after Venezuela is settled, with the tech geek, and his malicious vaccine operation neutralized (this is in reference to the *Venezuelan Shim-Sham dlc*)

# GTAOnline Venezuelan Shim-Sham DLC

This is the Venezuelan Shim-Sham:

- Shim Sham Tap Dance on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjfM4Wrj9UI

In case you don't get the shim-sham wording, an Ex-Green Beret tried to overthrow a Venezuelan dictator by himself with a small operations team. It is really strange, so I called 'his op' a shim-sham. A shim-sham is a type of tap dance, and now, it is here on my unofficial blog. It makes for good video game content creation ideas. Include Iran's ties to Venezuela and creating GTA Online content of a specific type is fairly doable. Article for reference:
