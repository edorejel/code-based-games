# Experimental Prison-Life DLC Concept

- __My thoughts:__ After rereading some of the stuff related to this DLC, I think I might have gotten a bit too involved in my research to create game content.


I hope a prison life or jail style dlc is in the works at Rockstar. I would prefer this type of DLC over a "Cops and Crooks" dlc.


#### Original Title: 
- GTAOnline Shot Caller Big Baller DLC 

#### Second Option for Title: 
- GTAOnline Proper Gangsters DLC 


> Both titles seem marketable and catchy.


#### Cars to Add

- Chrysler 300 SRT8 https://github.com/xpqx/videoGameDev/blob/master/GTAOnline/RockstarWhen/Chrysler%20300%20Srt8.md#chrysler-300-srt8


#### status: almost done designing it

things to do: reread and rewrite everything so that various elements are easily converted to in-game programming concepts that
can be used with the technology used in GTAOnline. No big thing, just thinking deeply about GTAOnline, and how 
things work from a programmer's perspective.


#### Alternative Titles: 

1. GTAOnline Gang Life DLC: One Way In, One Way Out 
2. GTAOnline Prison Life DLC: You'll get shanked!
3. GTAOnline Prison Life DLC (we'll find you)



# New Animations & Upgrades for this DLC

1. Players hanging out of moving cars showing off (throwing money for example).

2. Players hanging out of moving cars shooting or using their weapons.

3. Dual-wield guns while driving any type of motorcycle.

 - - 3a. Allow players to stand on moving motorcycles while using weapons.

 - - 3b. Allow playes to stunt or perform tricks on motorcycles aside from wheelies and stoppies.

4. Include the Terminator movie animation of Arnold reloading his shotgun while driving a motorcycle.

> I think Arnold might actually have created this animation for the movie, maybe he owns it? I don't know...

5. Allow players to stand and shoot their weapons inside of a car while driving any covertible vehicle.

6. Allow three players or four players in any two-seater convertible vehicle. See link:
https://github.com/xpqx/video-games/blob/master/GTAOnline/GTAOLifestyleDLCContent/VehicleLifestyleDLCContent.md

7. Include cholas, and the chola lingo. Currently, there are certain parts of Los Santos that are only occupied by
NPC characters resembling male street gang members. These should be diversified to include female street gang members.
Program the female street gang members to hurl many insults at the player.

8. Program prison gang NPCs to drag a player out of the vehicle to conduct the jailhouse hit. This is different from
the mugger behavior in GTAOnline wherein once a player calls Lamar for a mugger, the mugger-NPC does not pull out the
player from a vehicle to mug them. The mugger just stands close to the player, but does not interact with the player
while the player is in any type of vehicle.

9. Prison gang NPCs should be able to pull out a player from any type of vehicle to 
shank them. Once the prison gang NPCs drag a player out of their car to shank them, one of the prison gang NPCs
will drive off with the player's car. The player's car is assumed stolen. Player must pay the gang a fee to recover the car.
The car is not destroyed. The car is assumed stolen. This payment to recover the car would not be a payment to Morse Mutual Insurance to recover the car. If the player calls another car while the prison gang has their car in possession, then the car will be destroyed, and the player will have to call Morse Mutual Insurance to recover it. The player cannot recover their car by stealing
it back from the prison gang. The assumption is that the prison gang has some secret hideout where they keep stolen property.

10. Prison gang NPCs should have bodybuilder-type bodies, or just be bigger than regular NPCs to really sell the prison theme.
Rockstar Creator does have bodybuider-type bodies, so the bodybuilder body-type should not be difficult to program in-game.

11. Allow players to stunt and show off while riding any type of motorcycle by doing various types of tricks while riding.

12. Diversify all street gangs by prominently including female-NPC gangsters in every type of street gang hangout in Los Santos. For an added twist, make sure the female-NPCs are firing some heavy weaponry.

13. Include a heavy weapon upgrade in all street gang NPCs. This means all the street gangs will get an upgrade of
mini-guns, grenade launchers, RPGs, and homing launchers. This might be unrealistic, but it's a game.

# Create a Store Object for Urban and Hip-Hop Style Clothing Only

1. Clothing -- include more urban style, hip-hop style or gangster style clothing. If this is not possible, create a new store object
that sells urban, hip-hop, and gangster style clothing only. The new clothing store could be placed next to or near
Benny's Auto Shop. I feel this is more realistic than lumping all types of clothes into a few stores in San Andreas.
Basically, people don't go to Beverly Hills to buy Dickies. Include options for East Coast urban and hip-hop style clothing.

# Create a Store Object for a Lowrider Bike Shop

1. Include a lowrider bike shop. Currently trying to figure out who built the first lowrider bicycle and where it originated.
- Meet the Godfather of the Lowrider Bicycle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTwAIosrx3s
- Since we already have bicycles in GTAOnline, we have a bicycle object to serve as the super class. 
The lowrider bicycle would be a subclass of the bicycle class.

#### more animations to consider 
- https://www.pinterest.es/pin/325033298106348712
- https://www.pinterest.com/pin/545780048576274471

##### new vehicles
- lowrider bicycles
- various types of lowriders
- various types of donks
- lowriders are international, so include lowrider culture and art from other parts of the world

# Create a Store Object for a Smoke Shop

- In-game smoke shop should offer what real-world smoke shops offer, plus samples for the player to use.
- Enable a new category of in-game smoking where instead of smoking cigarettes, the player will smoke products from the smoke shop.
- Enable different strains of products from the Smoke Shop Object so that each particular strain the 
player can smoke, gives the player enhanced abilities.
- In the smoke shop, include NPCs that would resemble smoke shop aficionados in the real-world. <- marketing gymnastics right here
- Include lounge chairs for the player to be able to sit and enjoy products from the smoke shop.
- The players should be able to walk into a smoke shop, and just get so high, that they enter a different dimension. Alternatively, before the players embark on alien fighting missions, the players have to get so high, they end up in a different dimension.



# Got bored. Got inspired. Prison life DLC happened. 
        
        I think there is still room in GTAOnline for 
        this type of DLC. I think the mechanics of this DLC are similar to the casino.
        The only difference is that all the action takes place inside a prison.

        The gangs found in San Andreas can be enabled for more usage by the player. At least I think they can.
        I don't have insider knowledge as to why the gangs in San Andreas are not used to their full potential, but
        I think the prison life and gang life concepts should be explored further for a huge Gang Life DLC.
        
        Enabling more usage of the prison facilities can move more user activity up north towards the Sandy Shores areas.
        
        I like the idea behind this type of DLC. I'll try to flush it out some more by making it as clear and precise as possible.
        
        Ultimately, this type of DLC would serve to expand the player activity in the Sandy Shores area. Specifically,
        the prison near Sandy Shores should be opened up to player activity so that there are more players spawning
        in northen San Andreas. I would also like the prison renovated to accommodate this DLC.
        
        This DLC would also be huge.
        
           I like where this DLC concept is heading. Depending on how technical and precise this DLC gets, 
        I might make it into a mini-game. This can be made into a mini-game now. I'll really consider this. 

# Prison Life DLC Inspiration

#### Good movies for this type of DLC content are as follows:

#### 'Shot Caller' and 'Escape Plan' offer good mechanism to help create a behavioral hierarchy for the player while in prison.
- SHOT CALLER Trailer #1 (2017) Jon Bernthal, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Movie HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWf9Mp29EVo
- Escape Plan Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Arnold Schwarzenegger Movie HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI4EjV_x_PQ


#### Miami Vice offers really good and easy drug smuggling mechanics to duplicate in a game.

- Miami Vice (2006) Official Trailer #1 - Jamie Foxx Movie HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WCKJ7KaIZY 

 
Essentially, Miami Vice is more about the logistics involved in setting up a large scale distribution operation
wherein the head producer of contraband in a foreign country, hires third party distributors to load and off-load
their product at various locations for selling by the lower echelons of the business hierarchy.

#### Some drug smuggling concepts to be replicated in-game:

1. Ghost plane on flight radar concept definitely belongs in GTAOnline.
2. "Double-to-single-go-fast boats" mechanics definitely belong in GTAOnline.
3. "Double-to-single-go-fast boats" mechanics can be transfered over to cars wherein two players drive two
small cars very close together without crashing to make it look like there is one large car on a radar.

#### The business hierarchy is narrowed down to producers, distributors, and sellers.

1. producers produce the contraband -- prison gang will procure contraband for the player
2. player can also procure contraband, but it won't pay as much as if the prison gang procured all contraband
3. distributors distribute the contraband by any means to various sellers -- player will distribute contraband
4. sellers sell the contraband -- street gangs sell the contraband for the player and the prison 
gang to then generate passive income. As long as the sellers have contraband to sell, they will sell.
The selling action is complete when the street gang finishes selling the product. This is a different game mechanism
than from what GTAOnline currently has in that the player, in all businesses, has to deliver the goods to a checkpoint to 
sell them. Once the goods arrive at the checkpoint(s), the player is paid, and the sell mission is over.

# Player, Prison Missions Starting Point

#### inspirations taken from the following movies

- Scarface Trailer HD (1983) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pQQHnqBa2E
- American Made - Official Trailer [HD] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEBIJRAkujM
- TRIPLE FRONTIER Trailer | Ben Affleck Robs The Cartel in Netflix Movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r46I0ozaA-0
- Body of Lies (6/10) Movie CLIP - Reciprocity (2008) HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySu6q4ydPZQ


#### Initial Set-up (still flushing this part out)

- SecuroServ and the MC biker clubs allow players to join together to then make in-game money or do other stuff.
- For now, the player should be able to form a prison gang to then enter the prison.
- The players newly formed prison gang will help with the distribution.
- The first time the player initiates the steps to join the prison life business, it should be very cinematic, and 
climactic. Similar to how the Casino DLC was introduced.
- The difference for the prison life dlc and initial set-up is that the player will have to do something very climactic and dangerous
to be able to then partake in the prison life business venture. This will involve the player eventually going to prison.
This means the player will get caught. There will be no choice, but to get caught.


#### Passive income

Since the player will acts as a distributor, the player should give the street gangs ample amount of in-game time to 
sell an entire stock of contraband. However, the street gangs only sell when the player is logged in and in a free-roam
lobby. Once the street gang has finished selling a stock of contraband, assume the money is magically 
transferred to the correct parties, everyone involved in the procurement and distribution operation is paid, 
and the player gets their cut.

#### Delivering contraband for distribution in full lobbies

The player should get paid a small upfront fee for delivering contraband to the sellers. The fee should be proportional
to the amount of players in the lobby. This is similar to delivering other types of goods in full lobbies wherein players
receive a high demand bonus after completion of a sale.

#### The financial hierarchy, also called the money-flow, takes this shape:

# Entice Players

- Make the prison-style businesses and missions pay out higher than the rest of the missions and businesses to entice the player.
- Make the income passive to entice the players. This gives players two methods of generating passive income. First method
is the nightclub business. Second method would be the prison life business.
- Grant players immunity from receiving a wanted level, if they have bought into the prison business. This concept currently
exists in GTAOnline with hangars located in the military base. If a player owns a hangar in Fort Zancudo, the player 
can walk in and out of Fort Zancudo without receiving a wanted level. Similarly, if a player has bought into the prison life
business, the player can walk in and out of the prison without receiving a wanted level.
- The player will still receive a traditional wanted level while outside of the prison, unless a special perk exist within the game that allows the 
player to commit crimes without receiving a wanted level.
- Prison life businesses should pay high without the double RP and money event weeks. The prison life businesses should pay
higher during Double RP and $ weeks. During Triple RP and $ weeks, the prison life businesses should be the most lucrative.

# Player, Prison and Street Gang Hierarchy

    Using object-oriented programming principles to create the game hierarchy.
    This part gets a little technical.
    'Reverse-engineering' (just thinking deeply about GTAOnline game mechanics) certain aspects of 
    GTAOnline to help create the hierarchy.

- Two categories of contacts: 
1. Prison gang member
2. Street gang member

- Then, break these down by prison rules using the available street gangs in San Andreas.
- Available street gangs in San Andreas are:

1. Asian street gangs 
2. Biker/White street gangs 
3. Hispanic street gangs
4. Black street gangs

- According to prison life rules, and in-game concepts found in San Andreas, we then have four categories of prison gangs:
 
 1. White prison gangs
 2. Hispanic prison gangs
 3. Black prison gangs
 4. Asian prison gangs
      
- Player will be the head Shot Caller in prison, so player will have possibility of controlling all gang and contraband activity
within the prison as well as in the street.


Each prison gang will control some type of unique contraband. The player will work with one or all 
prison gangs as they procure contraband to then distribute to the street gangs. 
Each gang will have their set of unique fees.

The player will deliver the contraband from the prison to a street gang location, and the street gang will sell it.
The street gang will sell the contraband passively as long as the player is logged in and in free roam.


If the player only unlocks one prison gang to help distribute, then the player will only deliver and distribute contraband
to one street gang. For example, if the player unlocks the White prison gang, then the player will help deliver and
distribute contraband only to the White street gang. This is not as lucrative, but the player should have the choice.



# Prison Style Missions 

- Make more use of the prison. Teach players how to make prison shanks, prison weapons, importing and exporting prison contraband, prison mobile phones, prison economics, and prison life.

# Prison Currency

- Players cannot use traditional cash that is used in San Andreas. Players must convert their cash into prison dollars, to then
use them in the prison.
- Prison will hold exclusive items that can be purchased, but must be purchased using prison dollars.
- Inflation exists within the prison, so exchanging currency from cash to prison currency will not be equal.
- Players can either load up with shark cards, if they have zero cash to then exchange it into currency, 
or, players can purchase prison currency to be used in the prison.
- Maybe, enable gambling to take place inside the prison. Gambling should be in the form of games typically played in prison.
Players will need prison currency to gamble.

# Prison Gangs versus Street Gangs

- Introduce prison gangs into San Andreas. Prison gangs are different from street gangs.
- Separate the prison gangs and street gangs into distinct groups. 
- Player can use prison gang associates to put out hits on other players.
- Player can use prison gang associates as back-up similar to how player can call Merryweather mercenaries for back-up.
- Player usage of street gangs should be enabled in-game so that player can call street gangs as back-up similar to
how the player can call Merryweather mercenaries for back-up.


# Create a Drug and Contraband Procurement and Distribution Network

    This part gets a little technical as well.

- Prison gangs are for distribution of drugs and contraband to street gangs located in San Andreas.
- Player is retaining the services of the various prison gangs to help procure and distribute drugs, and contraband to sell. If the player does not help the prison gangs procure or delivery drugs or contraband to the street gangs for distribution, the player is still charged a fee for retaining the services of the prison gang on-call.
- As long the player is logged in, the prison gangs will procure drugs, and contraband to ready for distribution.


- Street gangs are for selling the drugs and contraband to earn passive income.
- Player is retaining the services of the various street gangs to sell the drugs and contraband. If the player does not 
deliver supplies for the various gangs to sell, the gangs still charge the player a fee for retaining their services on-call.
- As long as the player is logged in, the street gangs will sell the drugs and contraband for the player to earn passive income.
- The passive income is then used to pay the street gangs, and to then pay the prison gangs and prison security guards for their services. After everyone is paid, the player receives their cut.



- Enabling usage of streets gangs currently in San Andreas can allow the player to create a drug and contraband distribution
network. The player delivers the drugs or contraband to the street gangs, and the gangs will sell it for the player.
- Player will have to befriend and hire prison guards to help export contraband out of the prison. Prison guards must be paid
or else prison guards refuse to render services or they snitch on the player.
- Friendly prison guards will be required to help the player exit and enter the prison when necessary.
- Contraband will be snuck out in prison vehicles, or on foot.
- Player will sneak out of the prison with the help of guards, and attempt to deliver the contraband to the distribution
point. The gangs will sell the supplies for the player, and generate passive income.
- Currently, players just deliver goods or contraband to a checkpoint, and players are paid once deliveries are complete.
With the prison contraband, players will still deliver goods to a checkpoint, but the gangs will actively sell the drugs 
and contraband for the player. The player earns a profit after fees are deducted. This is why the money generated from the 
prison contraband should be higher than the other businesses the player can engage in.
- The income from the drug and contraband distribution network can serve as passive income for the player similar to how
the nightclub serves as passive income for the players.
- If the player decides to build a drug and contraband distribution network, the player will have to pay the gang
for their services.
- If the player doesn't pay the gang for their services, the gang can snitch on the player, steal the supplies from the player,
destroy the supplies, or sell the drugs and contraband without 
giving the player any of the revenue earned from the sells.
- If the gangs in the distribution network snitch on the player, the player will get raided, and lose all supplies and revenues.
These raids cannot be stopped.
- Other raids that happen in the game can be stopped.
- There will be two type of raids.
- There will be a new set of fees associated with using the newly created drug and distribution network.

- Create a mission where a player has to pretend to be a prisoner for an extended period of time.
- The player will have to survive in the prison.
- Player will survive using prison weapons such as shanks of various kinds.
- Player will have to learn how to make prison shanks while in prison.
- Player will survive using prison weapons such as guns of various kinds.
- Player will have to learn how to make prison-guns while in prison.
- Requirement that player learn how to make a prison-style 12-guage shotgun.
- Players will learn how to make prison-style alcohol.
- Players must procure the ingredients to be able to make the alcohol.
- Alcohol will be sold in the prison, or exported to the outside for a profit.
- Player will use prison economics to make money.
- Player will communicate using prison-made mobile phones.
- Player will use a prison-made mobile phone jamming device.

# Create New Contacts to Call the Player on Mobile

- Player will be called by new gang-related contacts.
- Include calls from Benny's auto shop once player begins to take part in gang-related businesses.


# New Prison-Style Businesses

- weapons dealer: sells prison-style weapons found only in the prison
- tattoo shop: sells prison-style tattoos found only in the prison
- food store: have to keep this store full with contraband. Player can purchase contraband in bulk, and sell to prisoners.
- Player can also buy food from the food store.

- Create a trust/honor system wherein player must do special favors to move up in rank.
- Section off certain parts of the prison to be taken over, and operated by the player.
- Certain sections will contain particular prison gangs that will work for the player.
- Player will have to generate revenue to pay the prisoners working for him.
- If player doesn't pay the prisoners working for him/her, eventually they double-cross the player, snitch on the player, or 
put a "green light" on the player.
- Player can lose their status in the prison similar to how player businesses can be raided. If a player loses their status
in the prison, they have to start all over, and move up in rank from the bottom.
- Player will have to learn how to create prison style tattoos.
- Player will have to learn how to make a prison-style tattoo gun.
- Player will have to tattoo other inmates to generate cash or favors.
- Eventually, player will unlock a prison-style tattoo shop found only in the prison.
- Prison tattoo shop will have unique tattoos that players can purchase only in the prison.

# Rewards

#### Player will unlock special prison jumpsuits. 
#### Two styles: 
1. orange prison suit
2. black-and-white striped prison suit

#### Unlock ability to put a jailhouse hit on another player. 
This is just two or three prison gang members sneaking up on a player, and simultaneously shanking the player. 
The shanking should be as real life as possible. The prison gang members
will not shoot any types of guns to perform the hit. The prison gang members will only shank the player. The prison 
gang members will shank the player until the objective is complete.

#### Jailhouse Hit is not a Bounty from Lester
Currently, players can call Lester on mobile to request a bounty placed on an unsuspecting player. This is not what the jailhouse hit
is going to be. The jailhouse hit is a separate mechanism, but similar to the bounty by Lester.

#### Rationale for prison gang jailhouse hit.
A calculated well thought out sneak attack that has been perfected through years of practice. The confidence to 
take out a target with your bare hands. Disciplined. Personal. This hit should contrast starkly with the hit performed
by the street gang.

#### The shanking should be new animations and character motions that are captured by actors.
Three prison gang member NPCs is good number to perform the jailhouse hit on any player in the free roam lobby.
I don't think the character animations I have in mind are programmed into GTAOnline, so the animations would have to
be played out by actors. Once this task is complete, the animations can be programmed into GTAOnline.

#### Animations coming soon.

#### No refunds for putting a jailhouse hit on a player.
Whether or not the prison gang is successful in shanking the player to death, there are no refunds for this service.

#### Unlock ability to have San Andreas gangs perform a drive-by on the player. 
These gangs will not exit their vehicles. The 
NPCs should be programmed to stay in the vehicles, and just shoot large amounts of bullets at the player. 
This is different
from the Merryweather mercenaries as these NPCs can exit their vehicles to take out the player.

#### No refunds for requesting a drive-by on a player.
Whether or not the street gang is successful in executing a drive-by on the player, there are no refunds for this service.

#### Rationale for street gang hit.
Anyone can learn to use a gun. Very little skill, experience, and practice required to learn and shoot. With enough
practice, obviously, there will be improvement in gun usage. However, street gangs are suspected of using guns in 
real life (even in "gun free zones"), and they do so irresponsibly. Using a gun on another person can be viewed as a 
cowardly act depending on the circumstances. Impersonal. Undisciplined.

#### Street Gang Hit is not a Bounty from Lester
Currently, players can call Lester on mobile to request a bounty placed on an unsuspecting player. 
This is not what the street gang hit
is going to be. The street gang hit is a separate mechanism, but similar to the bounty by Lester.

#### Animations for the street gang hit game mechanics
I think these animations are programmed into the game. They would just need minor adjusting to increase the spawning of 
bullet objects that then travel to impact with the player. 

#### New Animations for Street Gang Hit
- NPCs (and players eventually) will be able to hang out of a car, and shoot their weapons at the target.
- This a good animation to include in a game centered around cars.
