Inspiration from 


- Mortal Kombat: Sub-Zero And Scorpion's Rivalry Explained https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5muTlfCr-8

- players should be able to use ice as a weapon
- players should be able to use water as a weapon
- players should be able to use rocks or boulders as weapons
- players should be able to use trees as weapons
- players should be able to use sinkholes as weapons


#### Opening Up Sewers

- players should be able to crawl in and out of sewers to and from street-level <--- this motion can be used for a Horror DLC. Rockstar would have to open up the sewers for the players to use in GTAOnline. This would make the current GTAOnline map bigger in a sense that players would have new areas to explore by crawling in and out of sewers. The sewers can be used as part of more elaborate plots.

- notable quotes in this movie: "*you've got no imagination*"


#### Ice Cannon, Ice Missiles
Players can shoot ice at another player or on the road or other surfaces, thereby, freezing the player in place to get an easy kill, or cause the player or NPC 
vehicle to slip out of control by losing tire traction.

#### Water Cannon, Water Missiles
