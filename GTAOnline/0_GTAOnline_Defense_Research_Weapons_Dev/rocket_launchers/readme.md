# Rocket Launchers

#### four shot rocket launcher

This one should have been enabled in a Gunrunning DLC. Players need the ability to fire four missiles from their shoulders.


The player should have the ability to fire four rockets from a grounded position before reloading. 
Currently, players in GTAOnline can only fire one missile at a time in a grounded position.
