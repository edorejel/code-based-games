#### Mega Stickybomb

- Enable a mega stickybomb that is a combination of 6 blasts all at once.
- The Mega Stickybomb is created in-game by throwing 5 stickybombs onto a vehicle, then shooting an RPG at the five stickybombs. Instead of the player having to do this,
  it is better to encapsulate the behavior into one new Bomb-Type so that players can purchase it as an upgrade to then add to their array or list of weapons. 
- I assume the player weapons wheel uses a list data structure, possibly a doubly linked list to allow the player to scroll through their weapon-types.
