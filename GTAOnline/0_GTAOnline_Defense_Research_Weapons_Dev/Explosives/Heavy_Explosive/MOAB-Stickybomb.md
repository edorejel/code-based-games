#### MOAB Stickybomb

- Enable a mega stickybomb that is a combination of 6 blasts all at once.
- The Mega Stickybomb is created in-game by throwing 5 stickybombs onto a vehicle, then shooting an RPG at the five stickybombs. Instead of the player having to do this,
  it is better to encapsulate the behavior into one new Bomb-Type so that players can purchase it as an upgrade to then add to their array or list of weapons.
