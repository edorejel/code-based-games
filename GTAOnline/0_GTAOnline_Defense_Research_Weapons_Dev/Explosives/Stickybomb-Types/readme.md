#### Enable Different Types of Stickybombs

#### sent 8.5.2020

Players currently only have one type of stickybomb. I think players could use more.

- __emp stickybomb:__ should be enabled, this type of stickybomb would cause an emp blast to disrupt the vehicle it is attached to as well as a small radius surrounding the vehicle
- __energy blast stickybomb:__ should be enabled, this type of stickybomb would allow a vehicle to be launched into the air without the stickybomb itself blowing up the vehicle
- __smokescreen stickybomb:__ should be enabled, this type of stickybomb would use smoke to block out the screen of the vehicle driver or the target it is attached to, for a period of time
- a blinding flashing type stickybomb should be enabled, this type of stickybomb would flash repeatedly on the screen of the user, thereby, simulating the blinding effect
- __fireball stickybomb:__ this stickybomb blows up in a large fireball instead of the usual explosion, the fireball should be bigger than the molotov cocktail fireball and have the stickybomb detonation switch feature on it, creates a large fireball upon ignition,but the blast is small so the attention and hype is not drawn away from the fire itself
- __megaton stickybomb:__ combine the explosive power of 5 stickybombs being hit and ignited by an RPG rocket and put this power into 1 megaton stickybomb, I usually use this set up to destroy the heavier vehicles in GTAOnline
