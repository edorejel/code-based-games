# Surface-to-Air Missiles

*Analysis of the missiles in the Kosatka submarine.*

- The missiles of the Kosatka need an extended range upgrade option.
- The missiles needs an upgrade in speed and maneuverability. 
- These upgrades might be difficult to simulate given that it is the game engine camera creating the perception of a missile traveling through the air as the 
  player that launched the missile is viewing it.

# Surface-to-Air Alternative Missile Function
- Missiles once fired, can lock on to multiple targets. Then, the missile will release 5 (or less, maybe 3) smaller precision high speed, high maneuverability missiles.
- The main body of the vessel holding the smaller missiles will just fall to the ground from the sky. 
- The smaller missiles will pursue their respective targets using a homing ability.
- The player will be given a camera view of each smaller missile pursuing its target.
- Or the main vessel can fire off only one missile with the option of upgrading to carry multiple missiles up to 3.
- I think it is possible to perform this programming concept with Rockstarâ€™s current technology.
