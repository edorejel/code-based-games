# Exotic Vehicles

I would like to see the following vehicle types added into the game:
- bathtub car (could also be a shower car) or a hovering bathtub that is weaponized with missiles more precise than the Oppressor MKII's missiles
- hotdog car (I think I already asked for this one, not too sure.)
- banana car
- pool table car or a car with a pool table
- sofa car
- washing machine car
- a coffee table car

# Rims

- add various emoji style rims to the donks, lowriders and the other vehicles
- - include matching emoji liveries 
- I will send this idea to Rockstar, maybe they can do something with it.
