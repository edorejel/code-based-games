# Command Centers



#### Mobily Operations Command

__MOC Trailer__

- the liveries need updating (*they really clash with my current in-game character*)



This is an interesting programming problem. The liveries of the Avenger MOC should be enabled on the MOC trailer and cab. What's the best programming approach to accomplish this?
I'm thinking maybe Software Design patterns or basic OOP principles with inheritance and polymorphism being immediate solutions. 

We know a vehicle is a general class. A command center is a general class, but a vehicle can be a command center. Can a command center be a vehicle? This relationship could go either way. 
Then that means they both could be general categories of classes. Anyways, enough object-oriented analysis of GTAOnline.
