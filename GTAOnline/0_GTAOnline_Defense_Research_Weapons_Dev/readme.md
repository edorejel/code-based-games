# GTAOnline Defense Research and Weapons Development
   
* *Disclaimer: No relation to Rockstar games. I am very impressed with GTAOnline, so I decided to test my non-programming creative skills to make GTAOnline game content from a design aspect only. It was really more of a "creative fit".*

*  *I also use GTAOnline to practice my Computer Science fundamentals, systems analysis and reverse engineering skills. Other games can be used. I just happened to pick up a copy of GTAOnline for no reason whatsoever. Believe it or not, happenstance was involved 100% in that decision.*
   
* No relation to Rockstar games! (*I should have written this sooner!*)
