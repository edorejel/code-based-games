# Flare Gun MKII

An updated flare gun is needed. 


Shoot many flares at once to actually function as a missile defense system, since the missiles follow the flares in GTAOnline.


A flare gun should be able to fire 4 or 5 flares in a row in different trajectories regardless of where the player is pointing the gun.
