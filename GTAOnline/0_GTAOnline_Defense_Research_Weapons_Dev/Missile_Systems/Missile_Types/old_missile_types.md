# Missile Types First Draft

First draft fo the different types of missiles I proposed for hypothetical additions to the current iteration of GTAOnline. The behavior to simulate the missile would obviously have to be coded into the game. 

Some of these missiles should be very pricey in the game because they are very powerful, but it would make the game fun. The missiles should also be limited to, at most 5 per missile variant. Players should also not be able to equip all missile variants at once. A thorough analysis of what missiles and how many missiles ca player can use at a time would be required. Since GTAOnline has the feature called "God Mode," I don't think it would be ideal to create a scenario that would have a small group of players overpowered, and a large chunk of players underpowered. GTAOnline is a rough game to play. It can get toxic.

Inspiration for some of these missiles taken from various sources. 




~~#### super-duper missile~~

*old non-relevant news for now, times changed, let's put the super-duper missile back in the box for now*

- ~~time to ask Rockstar to include its equivalent with the exact same name (free large scale marketing for both)~~
- ~~homing enabled~~
- ~~patriot flames and smoke trail~~
- ~~very precise~~
- ~~made specifically to destroy commies~~
- ~~could work in well with the GTAOnline BioWarfare DLC concept~~
~~this is actually a good marketing strategy, during elections, experiment with online gaming advertisements that could be received positively by the gaming~~
~~world, however, don't over do it, or you risk ruining the game through politicization~~
~~Trump says US is developing a 'super-duper' missile â€“ video https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/may/16/trump-says-us-is-developing-a-super-duper-missile-video~~





















#### extended range missiles

- homing enabled
- these missiles are regular missiles, but with an extended range ability
- these missiles just take longer to explode when they have not hit a target and can travel farther
- these missiles can pursue a target for a greater distance when the homing variant is fired at a target
- these missiles shall have the homing ability of the Ruinder 2000 missiles









#### Futuristic Weapons and Missiles

 #### Players can Shoot Barrage of Missiles
 
 Players should have a weapon that can shoot a barrage of missiles from any surface that the player is standing on.
 The player should be able to shoot the barrage of missiles from any surface to the air or other targets.


#### missile that spawns other missiles
- shoot one missile at a target
- missile spawns 3 other missles, these 3 missiles lock on to the most immediate targets to destroy them
- the original missile takes out the original target
- the 3 spawned missles try to take out the most immediate targets


 
 #### Missiles that Fire Another Missile
 
 Missiles that shoot out another smaller faster missile projectile while in air. 
 Think of this as a missile within a missile. This missile inside the larger host missile will be smaller and 
 less lethal, but it would help keep the enemy at bay while playing GTAOnline.


#### Missiles that Fire Multiple Smaller Missiles (Homing Enabled)
Homing enabled. One large missile fires, explodes into multiple smaller missiles, the multiple smaller missiles can each take out multiple targets through the homing mechanism.
I large missile spawns, explodes, then four smaller missiles spawn and lockon to various targets. Each smaller missile targets
one unique target so that all missiles each takeout one unique individual target.


#### Missiles that Fire Multiple Smaller Missiles

One missile should be able to fire multiple missiles. Maybe four or five after the initial missile has exploded whether
or not the original host missile reached its target. Think of these as missiles within missiles.

 #### Missiles that Shoot Down Other Missiles

With these missiles, improve the flare system. The current missile 
    flare system is not great. Could be better.


#### Missiles that Shoot Flares 

    The flares serve to disrupt the path of any heat-seeking missiles that 
    may be trying to take out the missile before the missile hits its target.
    The flares should be automatic, but can be tested to be manual so the player 
    can control the fire rate of the flares.

#### Missile that Ignite Targets

    These missile do not explode upon impact like a traditional missile. They set the target on fire only upon impact.
    
#### Missiles with EMP Capability

    These missiles do not explode upon impact like a traditional missile. They release an 
    EMP to disable all vehicles within a certain radius. All vehicles are disable for a small period of time.
    Vehicle doors will function after an EMP missile hit because there are no vehicles in GTAOnline
    that offer keyless entry.
    
    Upon a vehicle being disabled by an EMP blast, the player will have the option of using their weapons to
    fend off an attack.
    
    The player will also have the option of using body-armor, and snacks for protection. 
    
#### Missiles that Release Toxic Gas

    These missiles do not detonate upon impact. They release a toxic gas upon impact. Gas spreads to a small radius.
    The gas is so toxic that it will begin to disintegrade vehicles. Upon impact by the toxic gas missile, a vehicle
    will begin the process of breaking down to the point where the vehicle is no longer serviceable.
    
#### Missiles that Release an Oil Sludge (I think we really need something like this.)

    These missiles release a large size oil sludge that can serve to make the players slip, and fall. The oil sludge
    from these missiles will also make vehicles lose control.
    
    Use of this weapon should be exclusive. This weapon will have the ability to lock-on to players that are 
    not in vehicles. This means that this weapon can be used to target and hit players that are not in
    vehicles of any kind.
    
    Once this weapon hits a player, the player is knocked down, and the oil sludge spreads around the ground, and
    the player. The player will slip and fall and remained immobilized in the oil sludge until the sludge 
    disappears. The oil sludge disappears in roughly 5 to 10 in-game seconds. This is a long time in a video game.
    
    Since this weapon will immobilize players, it should be exclusive.
    
    This weapon can only be purchased and used, if the purchaser has already purchased or unlocked a special device 
    that will be used in conjunction with the weapon. The special device is what allows the weapon to target players 
    that are not in vehicles. 
    
    This weapon presents a good opportunity to immobilize players, so the weapon should have some restrictions.
    
    This weapon can only be used against players that are wearing the special device. The special device is a
    small chip that is implanted in the neck of the player. The small chip allows the weapon to be used against
    players in vehicles, and players that are not in vehicles, as long as the chip is turned on.
    
    If the chip is off, the weapon will not target players that are not in vehicles. The weapon will only
    target players that are in vehicles.
    
    Alternatively, if the chip is already implanted into the neck of the players, the weapon will target 
    them regardless of whether the chip is turned on or off.
    
    The chip must be implanted in the player in order to use this weapon in the on or off setting.
    
    The chip and the weapon can be purchased as an upgrade, or unlocked via a special mission.
    Since this weapon requires a special chip to be implanted into the player's neck, I think it 
    could be unlocked in a Dooms Day Part II mission.
    
    This weapon is not usable without the chip implant in the player that is shooting the weapon, and the 
    player that is being targeted. This way, this weapon is not used against 'innocent' players.
    
    So, if two players have a chip implanted into their neck, they can both use this weapon against each 
    other. If a player does not have a chip implanted into their neck, they cannot be targeted by this weapon, and
    they cannot purchase this weapon.

#### Missiles that Release a Burst of Energy

    These missiles do not explode upon impact like a traditional missile. Instead, upon impact, these missiles 
    release a small burst of energy that can knock a vehicle off course, or knock a pilot off their Oppressor MKII.
    These missiles will damage a vehicle, but the damage will not be as deadly.
    These missiles are non-lethal force by themselves. This missile can disrupt the physics of other players and 
    vehicles. Upon doing this, this missile can be deadly.
    
 
Many of the missiles I mentioned can be found in the form of bombs that are dropped via airplanes. The goal now 
is to harness these weapons as missiles.

# Old Notes on Missiles

 #### preliminary in-game mechanics required:
 
 #### general in-game behavior of a missile defense system 
 - no behavior to simulate accuracy has been enumerated yet
 - a 'turn-on' component to simulate the flare being ignited
 - a shape object to represent the shape of the flare
 - a movement component to simulate the movement of the object
 - a speed component to simulate the speed of the object while moving
 - a wrapper component to wrap the colors around the shape object 
 - a color component to simulate the flare lighting and heat signature
 - a component to differentiate colors and temperatures, for example, the brighter the color, the hotter the temperature.
 
 - a color component to simulate the smoke trail of the flare
 - a smoke trail behavior component to create the movement of the smoke trail
 - a trajectory component to simulate movement in any direction
 - a sound component to simulate the sound of the missile defense system being fired
 - a sound component to simulate the sound of the missile defense system in action after being fired
 - an accuracy component to simulate targeting
 - a second part of the accuracy component is to 'wrap' potential targets with the component to enable lock-on ability
 - a 'bounce' component to simulate flares bouncing off of surfaces regardless of trajectory
 - a "float' component to simulate flares floating on surfaces meant to simulate water
 - a 'fade' component to simulate the flare burning out in the event the missile does not reach it, the flare just burns out after a period of time
 - a 'turn-off' component to simulate the flare turning off as a result of redirecting a missile, and the missile impacts with the flare, the missile impact and subsequent explosion destroys the missile and the flare
 - optional: make leftover debris after the explosion, the debris shall fade out after a few seconds
 - optional: make leftover debris after the flare burns out, the debris shall fade out after a few seconds


#### targeting accuracy should be another system
- - enumeration of accuracy behavior
- the targeting should be customizable in a separate system
- if a missile is too strong, for example, the targeting system shall have a mechanism to reduce the targeting accuracy of the missile in real time
- the missile defense system shall have customizable accuracy calibrations similar to targeting calibrations of the missiles
- the calibrations can be calculated to deflect missiles 100% of the time, or another percent value
- the higher the percent value, the better the missile defense system shall function in deflecting missiles

#### deflecting missile-types
- the targeting system shall deflect homing and non-homing missiles
