# Missile Types for GTAOnline

*Some of these missile might be too much to handle from a programming perspective.*

For example, adding the missile behavior of "homing" to an object might not function with the missiles' ability 
to also be a "homing" and "flashbang" missile or a "homing" and "emp missile".

There's also the issue of the price. Missiles are the ultimate weapon in GTAOnline so any missile that manipulates the player experience to a significant length should be pricey as well as limited in number.
This is to try to minimize the abuse of the missiles by tryhards.

- - heat-seeking
- - non-heat seeking
- - cluster bomb missiles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition 
- - bunker buster missiles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_buster
- - emp missiles: these missiles release an emp blast upon impact regardless of where the target is located (these would be just for fun mainly)
- - teleport missiles (homing enabled): when these missiles hit your aircraft (or other vehicle), you and your vehicle are teleported to the extreme opposite of the GTAOnline map. These missiles also serve to satisfy the in-game urge to 'get a player outta here.' Also, some players in-game often use the RPG on themselves to avoid being killed by another player to preserve their K/D. With a teleport missile, instead of choosing the easy way out, they can be teleported to a different part of the map.

- - flash bang missiles: when these missiles hit your aircraft, or vehicle, the player is momentarily blinded by the brightness of the missiles. The blindness effect would have to be created.
- - anti-gravity missiles: when these missiles hit your aircraft, they change the physics of the aircraft, meaning, forward becomes reverse, up become down, left becomes right, and right becomes left
- - deep gravity missiles: when these missiles hit your aircraft (or other vehicle), they send your aircraft as high as possible on the map, we're talking into deep space territory. As soon as the aircraft hits the highest point possible, that is, deep space, the aircraft may resume flight like normal (a vehicle would fall straight down).
- - time bomb missiles: when these missiles hit your aircraft, they slow all the mechanics down in the aircraft, these missiles don't destroy the aircraft, they just affect the sense of time while you fly the aircraft or drive the other vehicle
- - speed bomb missiles: when these missiles hit your aircraft, they speed up all the mechanics of the aircraft without destroying the aircraft (or vehicle)
- - sidewinder missiles: these missiles hit your aircraft or vehicle to make it only travel sideways for a period of time, sidewinders can only be used on aircraft
- - loopy-lune missiles: these missiles hit your vehicle or boat or motorcycle, and make it travel in a circular loop in any direction for a period of time
- - rotator missiles: these missiles make your aircraft rotate uncontrollably for a period of time
- - glue missiles: these missiles hit your aircraft and prevent you from entering by making you stick to the body of the aircraft
- - slime missiles: these missiles hit your aircraft and prevent you from entering by making you slide off the aircraft (I don't think there are any player slide animations currently in-game, they would have to be created.)
- - in some cases, if a missile cannot be coded for one reason or another, perhaps ammunition for a gun can be coded instead, for example, slime bullets or glue bullets instead of glue missiles or slime missiles

### Stickybomb Ammunition for RPG and Homing Launchers

- player should be able to fire stickybombs using the rpg and homing launchers
- when the stickybomb lands on the target, players shall have the option of detonating the stickybomb
