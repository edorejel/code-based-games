# Missile Types for GTAOnline

*Some of these missile might be too much to handle from a programming perspective.*

For example, adding the missile behavior of "homing" to an object might not function with the missiles' ability 
to also be a "homing" and "flashbang" missile or a "homing" and "emp missile".

There's also the issue of the price. Missiles are the ultimate weapon in GTAOnline so any missile that manipulates the player experience to a significant length should be pricey as well as limited in number.
This is to try to minimize the abuse of the missiles by tryhards.
