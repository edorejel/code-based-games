# Self-Balancing Mobile AI Defense and Attack Drones

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You want to stop protests? There's an idea for that. I could probably help, lol. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I'm curious, what should I call this thing? What kind of name? I think I will give it a feminine name, but I don't have one to give yet. For now, this project is my baby, but it doesn't have a name, lol.
- I do have a special nickname waiting to call my real future daughter (whenever I have kids), but I don't want to use it for my mobile defense AI drone, lol. It would just be weird, too weird. Okay, my baby, needs a nickname! Nickname time!
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- preliminary requirements:
- - - aerial - able to fly to various locations to identify protests, riots, and large crowds
- - - able to discern between riots, large crowds, peaceful protests, and violent protestors
- - - able to discern non-violent persons from violent persons within a large crowd in which some in the crowd are protesting, and some are not protesting
- - - aerial drone unit, and ground drone main unit can communicate with each other to identify hotspots
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I really should start working on developing, and deploying this thing, it could have been so helpful in today's protests to try to stop the violence, and illegal activity happening under the guise of peaceful protesting. If this thing is successful, Tony Stark would be so jealous. I'm going to give this thing serious consideration for development.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This thing, if it does happen, would be my pride and joy, almost like one of my kids, lol, except I don't have kids, but if it were, you know, my creation, it would be like one of my kids, cherished at every step of the way (even though it's an AI drone, lol).
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Aerial version will likely be considered.
- I was inspired by Benghazi to create this thing. This could have really helped in that situation.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- this is inspired from an actual 'tool' I want to design, the tool's primary purpose is to disrupt protests or rioters to eventually stop them, regardless of geolocation or terrain or size of the protests (think of it as the 'not-fucking around AI drone')
- this tool should be in some type of development now in secret, or so I hope, if not, I'll try to patent this one, and put it to use, embassies around the world could benefit from this type of drone
- this one is very doable in terms of development and deploying
- this courtesy brought to you by America and me
- by 'tool' I mean weapon
- inspiration also comes from eliminating the role of crossing guard to replace it with an AI self-balancing drone enabled with license plate scanner technology



- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For GTAOnline, the following perks should be enabled in the __Self-Balancing AI Drone__
- weapons enabled
- ground attack drones
- can fire in multiple directions
- self-detonates when taking damage, but targets player before detonation, the drone will detonate itself and the nearest players in range after a certain amount of damage has been received
- the drone will scan for the player in closest proximity, approach that player before detonation, then destroy itself with an explosion, once it has detected a player
- explosion covers a large radius to take out surrounding players
- this should be in GTAOnline now
