# GTAOnline Mars Rover 2020 DLC Update

- Add a Rover to GTAOnline to coincide with the launch of the Mars 2020 rover. 
- - This is more of a marketing thing and a gift to the players as well.
- - The goal of this would have been to implicitly place the Rockstargames logo onto the Mars Rover via GTAOnline using the human mind and NASA and JPL's Mars Rover.
- - Think of this as instead of the President of the United States calling NASA to congratulate them on another successful mission, instead he calls Rockstar Games for another successful game title (or earnings quarter).
