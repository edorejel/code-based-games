# GTAOnline Aerial Command Centers (no, I'm not kidding)

#### Living in the Sky

For the aerial command centers, I would like the players to essentially live in the sky. The aerial command centers can be viewed then as apartment buildings combined with the ability of a small command center. The sky, the deep parts of the oceans, inside mountains and inside the city sewers are parts of the current iteration of GTAOnline that have yet to be used to their full potential.

#### include the following:

- small airpod vehicles for the players to travel to and from their aerial command centers

- space missions would only be accessed through the aerial command centers
- space vehicles would only be accessed through the __purchase__ of an aerial command center
- vehicles to include for player usage: 
- SpaceX rockets
- NASA space shuttle
- Iron-Man Suit
- Master Chief Spartan Armor Suit
- Flying mechanical Horse pegasus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus

- Flying Space Chariot An actual chariot with mechanical horses pulling it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot

This concept could be brought to life in the current iteration of GTAOnline. Include the U.S. Space Force with a few space missions,
and aerial command centers would fit right in.

#### Space Balls Winnebago

Space Balls Winnebago would be a vehicle to unlock. This vehicle can be included in GTAOnline now. I'm not sure why it isn't.

Going to send this idea to Rockstar, GTAOnline really needs a flying Winnebago with missiles and lazers!
