There are several housing projects in Los Angeles, but the ones in Boyle Heights appear to be the ones that were used in
GTAOnline. The demographics and the murals in the video game give off the Boyle Heights/East LA vibe.
The projects in GTAOnline have a lot of murals. The projects on S. Lorena St., and Olympic Blvd. also have many murals.
The similarity is definitely there.
