This small intersection was changed a little for GTAOnline, but the vibe it gives off is that it's Sante Fe Ave., and Olympic Blvd
intersection just off of Boyle Heights, Ca. This intersection in San Andreas might be a combination of Alameda and Santa Fe in
real life Los Angeles.



GTAO Life

Gas Station on Corner (See prices reflect current prices, not sure if these change with current real life gas prices. They should.)

La Mesa San Andreas (Very near real life Boyle Heights with a little bit of Los Angeles.) The streets resembled in this picture are
Santa Fe Avenue, Vermont Avenue and Olympic Blvd. The street resembled could also be any major street that has a good view of the
Hollywood (Vinewood) sign.

Real Life

Gas Station on Different Corner

Sante Fe Ave and Olympic Blvd intersection.

Los Angeles, Ca. (Nearing DTLA and Art District and Film District)

I thought this gas station on Alameda was a close second to the GTAO life gas station.
