This street looks like a combination of streets.
Those streets are Vermont Ave, Alameda St, Santa Fe, (the gentrified parts near DTLA and the film district near Santa Fe) in Los Angeles
right before you hit the Vinewood (Hollywood) sign. 

The bridges give a little hint of Soto St on your way to Boyle Heights and East LA.
