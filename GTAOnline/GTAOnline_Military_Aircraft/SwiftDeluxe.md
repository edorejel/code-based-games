# Swift Deluxe (Golden Helicopter)

Modification to the Swift Deluxe Helicopter 
This helicopter costs $5 million+ GTA dollars.
The problem with this helicopter is that it does not do anything that other cheaper less expensive helicopters do.
This needs to be changed to justify the massive price tag.
What's worst is that while sitting in this helicopter, the player cannot enter passive mode.
This helicopter is only for showing off that you bought the golden helicopter.
It has no functionality whatsoever. It needs to be updated with weapons systems, armor, missile defense systems, and 
stealth capability.

Translate all publicly known presidential perks of Marine One to in-game player perks that can be programmed onto the Swift Deluxe helicopter.
This could justify the price tag.
