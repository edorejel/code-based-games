 # Experimental Concepts for GTAOnline using Dogs as Player Reward Upgrades

- __DISCLAIMER:__ None of these graphics are from a real DLC. I just made them up using Microsoft Paint, and some creativity. The images are basic, but they deliver a powerful message. GTAOnline's logo just happens to fit perfectly with the message being delivered.

Potentially, a few DLCs can be made just using dogs. The following DLCs, from my perspective, can maybe happen:

 - GTAOnline Police K9 DLC focusing police dogs only
 
 - GTAOnline Military K9 DLC focusing on military dogs only
 
 - GTAOnline: K9's and Tech 9's DLC focusing on dogs for general use throughout the game
 
 - The players will need a Pet Shop to buy their pets as well as customize them using the Pet Store Barber.
 - - Players will also need to feed their pets, so trips to the Pet Shop will be required.
 - - Exclusive dog liveries to customize vehicles can be included.
 - - Dog clothing. Dog jewelry. The typical GTAOnline stuff.
 
 - The general DLC for dogs can be released as a Quality of Life update.
 
  - Police dogs and dogs in general might not be part of the GTAOnline universe at first glance, but we have flying motorcycles, jet-packs, and rocket-powered vehicles. A dog will fit right in.
- Players allowed extensive use of Chop the dog in GTA Online.
- Players call Lamar to get Chop to attack another player.
- Similar to how players call Lamar to mug another player.
