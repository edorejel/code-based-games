# GTAOnline Sea-Based DLC

This DLC would be a non-naval warfare DLC. There are a few options for sea-based DLCs. They are listed below.

(1) GTAO Gunrunning III: Naval Warfare

(2) GTAO: Pirates of San Andreas

(2a) GTAOnline Skull and Bones

(2b) GTAOnline Cross and Bones


For a sea-based DLC, there's actually a couple of ways this can be done.

(1) Option One is the Naval Amphibious Warfare DLC, which is good, but would require some modifications to make it really good for the players.

(2) Option Two is a strictly Pirates of the Carribean type of DLC where old-style ships are included instead of modern ships. Some research into history would be required to give the ships an authentic look and feel.

(3) Option Three is a Happy-Go-Lucky sea-based DLC filled with some contraband fun and sea-based activities during free roam missions. For Option Three, I like this concept here minus the lead character: https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/mzn363/aquatics_and_other_antics_dlc_concept_trailer/

(3a) The lead character, Agent 14, does not fit the Happy-Go-Lucky lifestyle. I'd like a cool chunky dude type character wearing a Hawaiian shirt and some shorts for this type of DLC. A polo shirt and some shorts could also work.

(3b) GTA Online - Who Is "AGENT 14" (Steve Haines)? - GTA 5 Mystery Character Agent 14! (GTA V) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIHHti6G3G0

(3c) Agent 14 is not Steve Haines. They look nothing alike. https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Agent_14
