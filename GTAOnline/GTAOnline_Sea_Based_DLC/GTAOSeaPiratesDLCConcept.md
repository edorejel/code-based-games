Pirates DLC concepts.

Must include ghost pirate ships of various sizes and perks to replace the yachts.
A pirates DLC is not a naval warfare DLC. The two concepts are mutually exclusive.
Thus, GTAO can release two sea based DLCs. One is a pirate DLC and one is a naval warfare DLC.

Three ship types similar to how we have three yacht types in GTAOnline:

- The Nina
- The Pinta
- The Santa Maria
