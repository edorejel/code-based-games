# Masks, Costumes, and Weapons Requested

These are various masks/costumes that I asked Rockstar about including in GTAOnline. There is no motivation behind the 
masks requests other than it would be funny, and not make any sense. Original request sent via Rockstar's feedback email address on Dec. 29, 2016.

For the Mariachi outfit, I still want a Mariachi outfit in GTAOnline because it is one of the most famous cultural pieces of attire next to a Kimono, African attire, or Hawaiin grass skirts. The Mariachi outfit is in GTAOnline, but I don't think players can wear it. 

There is no motivation behind any of the masks, clothing, or weapon requests other than it'd be funny and
fall within the GTAOnline universe.

Some masks were probably already in GTAOnline and enabled for use, I just didn't check.

4b. Weapon: Holy Water Bottles (Thrown at enemy, and enemy is burned on contact. Added bonus, after player death, show soul of enemy being taken to heaven, or hell. The liquid in the bottles should be a lethal acid mixture.)

8. Turban

8a. Weapon: sickle (There's various types of sickles. I'd say to add the sickle that is immediately recognizable as a sickle.)

9a. Pirate eye patch

9b. Male version of Pirate Hat

10d. Weapon: Maracas (Basically, I want to club someone to death with maracas, and be able to play the maracas. Also, upon impact with victim's body, or surface, the maracas should make a musical sound.)
