# Mugger Object Behavior

I love the mugger NPC. To add an interesting perspective, the players should be able to play the mugger, or Rockstar can add a slight narrative to the mugger to see what the mugger
does after it steals someone's belongings. Think of this as watching a movie called "A Day in the Life of a GTAOnlne Mugger*.

- Entertain the possibility of having two or three muggers come after the player. Similar to the Merry Weather Mercenaries that can be called to then attack a player. I think this game behavior could be a perk with a prison style dlc such as the one I designed here: https://github.com/xpqx/code-based-games/tree/main/GTAOnline/GTAOnline_Prison_Life_DLC#experimental-prison-life-dlc-concept
- Ideally, the players could live in the projects or the apartment complexes or the city locations that are used by the in-game gang criminal elements.

- With the optimizations listed above, I would like for the players to increase their interactions with the gas stations, and Ammu-nation. The players would also increase their interactions with Mugger Object (I'm sure this one would definitely happen).

- An example of awesome NPC-mugger programming dynamics. The mugger steals the vehicle of the player, while also stealing the player's money.

- The mugger should be able to pull players off or out of their vehicles to steal their vehicles regardless of the vehicle being used. In the process, the mugger 
should also "steal" the following items:
- - money
- - snacks (and everything else)
- - armor
- - ammo
- The mugger will "shank" the players after performing the above actions.
- This will hopefully lead to an increase in NPC-mugger interactions between players.

## Mutli-Environment Mugging Enabled
- The mugger should be able to mug a player in any type of environment such as land, sea, or air.
