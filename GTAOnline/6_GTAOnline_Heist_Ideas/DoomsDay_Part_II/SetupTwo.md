Unlock: New high-tech hyper jet
        
        Jet is a brand new kind of alien military weapon built using alien modular technology.
        Traditional fighter aircraft travel in aircraft carriers.
        Alien jet can be shipped in separate pieces, then reassembled at the destination in 15 minutes flat.
        Instead of using an aircraft carrier to 'deliver' jets into a particular zone, a large
        aircraft can air drop the pieces of the hyper jet so that it can be reassembled upon landing.
        Once fully assembled, hyper jet is combat-ready.

Caveat I: Players must assemble the jet in the air while in motion in order to steal the 
jet and pass the mission. Once the players pass the mission, the hyper jet with alien technology is
unlocked.

Caveat II: Players will not finish assembling the hyper jet in mid air while in motion. Eventually, the 
players will assemble just enough of the jet in mid air to fly the jet straight down. This will be a good thing
because the players will have to fly straight down to connect with the final piece of the hyper jet before 
everything and everyone hits the ground. The final piece of the hyper jet just happens to fall down without a parachute
right when the players were close to interfacing with it.
