       I'll see how far this goes. 
      
       Working with what is available and what I know about GTAOnline gameplay without looking at any code.
        
        - 4 set-ups maybe 5
        - 1 main heist split into two parts.
        

      Key phrases to develop the set-ups and main heist: 
    
      Antagonist: "What happens when I don't just go away."
      Protagonist: "What happens when I don't get scared."
                    
      Key theme surrounding Dooms Day II: Human Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence
      
      Key plot twist: You were just a decoy.

      Spoiler #1: Cliffford is alive.
       
      Spoiler #2: Cliffford is a new contact.
       
      Spoiler #3: Lester is no longer a contact after all set-ups and heists are complete. DUN DUN DUUUUN!!! (Dramatic Sound Effect)
