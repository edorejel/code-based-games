# GTAOnline Humor

 *It's funny to me.*

GTAOnline has some of the best dialogue I've ever heard. The writers did a fantastic job.
Below are a few noteworthy examples.


1. "He's f_cking with your head, baby." (this one is really funny) - Spoken by a random non-playable character (NPC) in the game near Alta St., in Alta, San Andreas.

2. "Soon, the only clubbing we'll do, will be on a computer." - Spoken by Tony while sitting in the club doing administrative work. Club location is Los Santos International Airport (LSIA). (*Given the pandemic, this quote is funny.*)

3. "How I got into this business? I will never know." - Spoken by Tony at the beginning of a nightclub cargo sell mission. (*This one...hmmfp.*)
